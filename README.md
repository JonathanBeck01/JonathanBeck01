- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jon Beck!
- My vision is to be the most respected member of whatever organization or team I am a member of. I want to be known as approachable, effective, teachable, efficient, and creative. The experiences that I have acquired over the years of my academic and professional career have cemented my desire to work with and learn from the best, to train the next generation of cohort to be their best, and to apply my skills and abilities to create resilient products that help people perform their best.

- My time working to achieve my goal of a bachelor‚Äôs degree has taught me a lot about myself. I am proud of the work that I have put into my academic career, and I am proud of the results.

- My capabilities include both hard and soft skills. My technical aptitude has placed me on a team of highly skilled technicians and process engineers; my personal skills helped me achieve a leadership position. My skillset is varied and wide ranging, but the most important lesson that I have taught myself is that if I am going to do something, I am going to do it right. ‚ÄúRight‚Äù can mean different things depending on the context, but whether the top concern is outputting a minimum viable product as quickly as possible or achieving a goal as safely as possible, I am always striving to do a job to the best of my ability.
